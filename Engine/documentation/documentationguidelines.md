# How to use doxygen

In order to comment our code base we can make use of the JAVADoc notation:

```java
/**
* @brief Brief description
* @details Detailed description
**/
class TestClass{}
```

or we use the more common method of `\[command]`

```cpp
/**
* \brief  Brief description
* \details Detailed description
**/
void function(Type argument);
```



Doxygen will understand both if you have the right settings in your doxygen file.

## Doxygen file - settings

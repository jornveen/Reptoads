This Software Product may allow services operated by SEL and/or its affiliates or third parties authorised on their behalf to be accessed which allow users of the Software Product to enjoy certain on-line or multiplayer features and functionality associated with the Software Product (“Online Features”). These services and Online Features may, however, require payment of additional fees. In addition, access to and use of such services/Online Features and other goods or information made available as part of such services may be subject to completion of a registration process and acceptance of additional terms and conditions including, but not limited to, privacy policies governing the use and processing of personally identifiable information. Importantly, not all purchasers of this Software Product will be able to register or benefit from such services (including Online Features associated with the Software Product). These services and Online Features may not be available in your country, are not guaranteed to be available for any period of time (and may be subject to suspension or withdrawal at any time) and may, for example, be subject to age restrictions. An internet connection will be required to access Online Features. 

Where you use Online Features we and our affiliates may also collect, store, process, distribute and publicly display certain data concerning your gameplay. This data may include your user name, gamertag, scores, rankings, results, achievements and any other personal profile information which you may choose to make available for other players to see. Without prejudice to any consents which you may give us under any other agreement between you and us with respect to such data, any data which personally identifies you will be collected, stored, used, processed and distributed in accordance with SEL's Privacy Policy referred to in Paragraph 5 below. 

5. Your consent to the use by us of certain Data

Without prejudice to paragraph 4 above, We may from time to time during your gameplay collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information (i.e. information which neither identifies you nor is linked to, associated with or capable of being used to identify, you) about your hardware system including how you are using the Software Product (including information about your successful installation and removal of the Software Product). This information may also include your internet protocol (I.P.) address (a numeric number assigned by your internet service provider to identify your PC). This information may be used not only to help you play the game on the Software Product over the Internet (where the Software Product contains Online Features) but also to help us better understand how our customers are using the Software Product, their behaviour and preferences, so that we can improve our computer games and services in the future. This information will not, however, be used to personally identify you without you being aware of it and without your separate consent. This information and any other data which may be provided by you to us or which may be collected by us in connection with your installation and use of the Software Product or any Online Features will be collected, stored, retrieved, used and distributed in accordance with SEL's latest Privacy Policy and Cookies Policy applicable to your region, which are located at http://eu.square-enix.com/en/documents/privacy and http://eu.square-enix.com/en/documents/cookies respectively.

In the event of any conflict between any provision of the Privacy Policy and this Paragraph 5, the Privacy Policy shall prevail.

6. In-Game Advertising
The Software Product may incorporate technology (which may be provided by SEL or third party service providers engaged by SEL (each a "Dynamic Advertising Provider")) which enables advertising to be uploaded into the Software Product on your PC, and changed while the Software Product is being played on-line. In order that the Dynamic Advertising Provider is able to direct advertising appropriate to your Software Product and geographic region, as well as to the correct location within the computer game, certain data and information may be retrieved and retained by the Dynamic Advertising Provider including your I.P. address, geographic location, in-game position, and information concerning the appearance of advertising visible during your gameplay (for example, the length of time an item of advertising was visible, the dimensions of the advertisements). In addition, the Dynamic Advertising Provider may assign a unique identification number which is stored on your PC and which is used to monitor and calculate the number of views of dynamic advertising during gameplay. None of the information collected for this purpose including the identification number can be used to identify you. 

The technology employed by Dynamic Advertising Providers may be located outside your country of residence (including outside of the European Union).

Where a Software Product incorporates dynamic advertising technology, the technology which serves the provision of dynamic in-game advertising is integrated within the Software Product. This means that if you do not want to receive dynamic advertising, you should only use the Software Product when you are not connected to the Internet. By playing the Game when connected to the Internet you consent to our use of dynamic advertising as described in this Paragraph.

7. Termination
Without prejudice to any other rights, SEL may terminate this EULA immediately without notice if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this EULA.

This limited warranty is in addition to, and does not affect, those of your statutory rights which cannot be excluded or limited in any way under the applicable law.

Where the Software Product is recorded on a physical medium supplied by SEL, SEL warrants to the original consumer purchaser of this Software Product that the physical medium on which the Software Product is recorded will under normal use and conditions be free from material defects in materials and workmanship for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of purchase. The entire liability of SEL under this limited warranty will be, at SEL's sole option, either (a) to return of the purchase price paid for the Software Product; or (b) to repair or, at SEL’s option, to replace free of charge the Software Product that does not meet this limited warranty provided the following procedures and conditions are observed.

Where this is not possible for any reason (and provided it is within the period of 90 days from the date of purchase) the defective medium should be returned to SEL at the address specified in the manual accompanying this Software Product together with the Required Material and address of the location where the Software Product was purchased. 

9.2 The limited warranty in paragraph 9.1 above is void and shall not apply to media which has been subject to misuse, accident, damage or excessive wear. Any replacement Software Product will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer.

9.6 Some jurisdictions do not permit the warranty disclaimers or limitations on liability set forth in this paragraph 9. Nothing in this paragraph 9 shall affect your statutory rights as a consumer which under the applicable law are not capable of exclusion or limitation. These statutory rights may vary from state/jurisdiction to state/jurisdiction.

Each party irrevocably submits for all purposes in connection with the EULA (including any such dispute or claim) to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts, except that nothing in this EULA shall limit SEL’s right to bring any action against any party in any other court of competent jurisdiction, nor shall the bringing of such action in one or more jurisdictions preclude the bringing of any other such actions in any other jurisdiction (whether concurrently or not) to the extent permitted by the law of such jurisdictions.

10.2 If you acquired this Software Product in the United States of America this EULA and any claim or dispute of whatever nature arising out of or relating to this EULA shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, USA and subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts situated in San Francisco, California, USA.

10.3 The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this EULA.

11. Injunction

12. Indemnity

13.4	SEL reserves the right to amend this EULA at any time, at its sole discretion, but will post such changes on the Square Enix website and/or will otherwise communicate such changes to you. You accept that such unilateral changes may be necessary to take account of, for example, changes to any digital rights management system used, or, where applicable, changes to the STEAM™ service where STEAM™ software is used. If any such future changes to this EULA are unacceptable to you or cause you to no longer be in compliance with this EULA you may terminate this EULA in accordance with the above Termination provisions. Your installations and use of any updates or modifications to the Software Product or your continued use of the Product Software following notice of changes to this EULA will constitute your acceptance of any and all such changes to the terms of this EULA.
